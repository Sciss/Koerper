Spherical coordinates: ISO "physics" style: 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system#/media/File:3D_Spherical.svg
- phi = azimuth, 0 to 2pi
- theta = elevation, 0 to pi (0.5 pi = equator, 0.0 = north, 1.0 = south); 
  lat = 90 degrees - theta

Node deletion:

- technically, the edge removal messages are sent first,
  the node removal message is sent last

Node creation:

- technically, the node creation message is sent first,
  the edge creation messages are sent last

## Todo

- Seems the first aging edge is repeated twice. Perhaps the buffer in the edge-map is not correct.

## Session

- rec-chunk needs to free itself
- audio files should go into sub-directory
- we need an ensemble to put the thing into

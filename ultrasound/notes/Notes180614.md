# Rotational Movement

- it would be nice to use the stochastic polling (instead of exhaustive run) to determine a
  'centre of gravity' (for example), and issue a movement towards that centre
- how to avoid that, if calibration is not 100% correct, the eye remains always on the same side?
  (if the stochastic sample is small, at least there is a chance of enough rotations)
- it would be nice to define the motion through a spring force or similar, so that when the
  centre moves, there is still inertia, and the movement naturally keeps adjusting to the moving
  centre.
- thus, at any time, there are is the current rotational vector (position), along with its
  derivative (velocity), and we need a strategy to translate that into incremental rotations
- perhaps the easiest is to use XYZ for the centre of gravity and velocity vector as well
  (it could even be using Euclidean maths, and then simply normalise the current position?)
- and we should limit velocity with some sort of friction
